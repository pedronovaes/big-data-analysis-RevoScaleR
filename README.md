Some codes for big data analysis using RevoScale R, an R package that provides functions for performing scalable and extremely high performance data managemente, analysis and visualization.
RevoScale R are particularly useful in three common situations:

1) to analyze data sets that are too big to fit in memory and,
2) to perform computation distributed over several cores, processors, or nodes in a cluster, or
3) to create scalable data analysis routines that can be developed locally with smaller data sets, then deployed to large data and/or a cluster of computers.
